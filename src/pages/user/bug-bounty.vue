const html = `Dear users:

4EVERLAND Alpha version has been officially launched on August 16. This version supports DWeb hosting, decentralized gateway, decentralized domain name, data services and other products and protocols, you can quickly access Web3.0 through 4EVERLAND HOSTING.

To ensure the long-term and stable development of 4EVERLAND, 4EVERLAND is now launching a bug bounty program with total $1 million dollars initial bounty. In addition, we are offering a maximum reward of $20,000 dollars for identified bugs. We hope to have more professional security researchers through this activity and join in the ecological construction of 4EVERLAND together. 

<h4>Scope of application</h4>
This program is limited to bugs found on *.4everland.org. 4EVERLAND will evaluate the rewards based on the security impact of the bug report.

The following situations are out of the scope of this Bug Bounty Campaign:
<ul>
<li>Third-party applications deployed on 4EVERLAND;</li>
<li>Bugs that have already been reported or discovered in third parties' contracts built on 4EVERLAND;</li>
<li>Bugs caused by the following activities: front-end errors, DDOS attacks, automated tools, damage or abuse of third-party systems or services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reward Plan</h4>
On August 16 2021,4EVERLAND officially launched the 4EVERLAND Bug Bounty Campaign with total $1 million dollars initial bounty. We will launch the next phase of Bug Bounty Campaign after the initial bonus is distributed.

The severity of those bugs will be calculated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):

<table class="e-table-1 mt-3 mb-3 ta-c" style="max-width: 500px">
  <tr>
    <td>Rating</td>
    <td>4EVER Reward</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Critical(9.0-10.0)</td>
    <td>$10,000 - $20,000 4EVER</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>High(7.0-8.9)</td>
    <td>$5,000 - $10000 4EVER</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium(4.0-6.9)</td>
    <td>$2,000 - $5,000 4EVER</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Low(0.1-3.9)</td>
    <td>$200 - $2,000 4EVER</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In addition to severity, rewards will also be weighed against the impact of bugs found and the difficulty level of finding them. 4EVERLAND may award an additional reward bonus for exceptional reports. This will be done at 4EVERLAND's discretion .
